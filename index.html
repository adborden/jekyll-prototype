  <h1>{{ site.title }}</h1>

  <p>Welcome to [Jekyll prototype](https://github.com/adborden/jekyll-prototype), a simple toolkit for prototyping websites.</p>

  <p>Weâ€™ve tried to keep this template as simple as possible to get out of your way. You can learn more on our <a href="{{ "/getting-started" | prepend:site.baseurl }}">getting started page</a>. If you're familiar with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), edit <code>index.html</code> to get right to work.</p>
